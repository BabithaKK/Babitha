                         JAVA
						 
1)Ans: java is an programming language.It is used to build apps and other websites.javac is a java compiler which will compile the program after writing the code.
2) Ans: JDK stands for java development kit ,without JDK we cant compile the program.It is present in the bin folder
        JRE stands for java runtime environment.it is used to run the program.
		JVM it stands for java virtual machine which is not visible to us and it is present inside the jdk.
3) Ans:one of the limitations of array is it must contain the same data type as before when it is declaring
4) Ans: class is a location where the program starts and where we declare the class name
        object is a grop of variables
		signature of the class is it must starts with:: class Class_Name {}  
5) Ans: Array is a group of characters or variables that is declared together with the symbol [].
6) Ans:we write the program in language which is english that is not understand by the system that program in .java format
       this .java file is converted into .class file that will be in binary form which the system can understands.
       here the difference is we will write the progrem that is saved as .java and then it is convertd into .class format.
7)Ans: 6
8) Ans: main method is  the location where the actual program starts.we can run the program without main method but it will not be compiled.
9) Ans: Java is a object oriented programming language.It is used to develop the apps .It contains JDK,JVM, and JRE 
10) Ans: variable is a group of characters .It may be a characters,integers or decimal values 
          it is classsified into 2 types 1.static varibles
                                         2.Nonstatic variables
11) Ans: class is a nonstatic variable that we are  giving to our program  and it my be anything. clss variable is a name of the program
12)Ans:  Data type is a static variable which is used to store the perticular information
        It i classified as
         1. int
         2.float		 
		3.char
		4.double
		5.string
		6. boolean
		7.long
		8. short
 char is used to store the characters
 int is used to the integers
 float is used to store the decimal values 
boolean will dispaly the output as TRUE or FALSE
double and long is used to store the big values
13).Ans: JAVA is a object oriented programming language
         Java is platform independent.
		 It can works on any operating system
14) Ans: array is classified into single dimensional and multi dimensinal array


15) Ans: array index out of bound exception is a error occurs when  declaring all the variables. when it is diferent from previously declared statements
       this line will be printed.  and it may  also caused dut to an synatx error in the line. 		 
16)System.out.println() is a statement where we will declare the statements  to print the output 
 here System means predefined  class variable
 
 17) double equal opertor is used to compare the two or more given objects.
 18)the dot operator is used to access the class or structure of the member.
 19) the object class is the basic class of all classes
 
 
 
 20)  Ans:key words of java are
 int
 float
 char
 double
 float
 public
 private
 class
 new
 break
 long
 double
 array
